*Examining the nocode web app one year after its launch*

# Key facts over the past year

According to the Wayback machine, I have launched nocodefunctions [around May 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210503153337/https://nocodefunctions.com/). Since then, it:

1. went from 1 function (sentiment analysis) to 9: sentiment analysis, creating networks from text, topic detection, turning lists into networks, gephi <-> vosviewer converter, data annotation tool, network link prediction, css highlighter, pdf matcher.
2. transitioned to being fully open source ([:octocat:](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions))
3. is now localized [in 107 languages](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/translated-web-app-in-107-languages-i18n/)
4. went from accepting plain text files as a data input, to accepting excel, csv, pdf files and tweet search
5. has ~ [200 active users per week](https://public.nocodefunctions.com/)
6. has experienced close to zero downtime
7. has a few dedicated users who helped with bug reports and quality checks, making the site improve much faster


# Overall feeling

The [long-term objective with nocodefunctions](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/long-game/) is to provide a free, user friendly, robust web app helping a variety of audiences to use common (but sophisticated) data analysis functions, offered in their best-in-class versions.

After a year, this objective has started being fulfilled. I got informal reports about use of nocodefunctions in classrooms, in academic research and by governing bodies.

Another objective for nocode functions is to serve as a testbench for the new functions I develop, as an academic researcher. Bringing a function to the app forces me to go beyond the development of an algorithm. I now must also develop a web interface for it (in 107 languages!), so that it can be featured on https://nocodefunctions.com.

This is exactly what happened last month with the development of a new text mining technique that performs sentiment analysis *and provides a detailed explanation of the result - again, in 107 languages*.
While I am writing the academic paper that will develop the internals of this technique, the function is already available on the front page of nocode functions, and [as an API as well](https://nocodefunctions.com/umigon/sentiment_analysis_tool.html). It helped me get feedback to improve on it (thank you [Ver√≥nica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ver%C3%B3nica-espinoza/)!).

# Next steps

The next steps consist in going slowly and surely. The goal will remain to provide a free, no-registration, click-and-point experience to execute data analysis functions with minimum hassle.

I will improve the documentation, starting with submissions to academic journals that specialize in relevant topics. The doc on Github will also get some love, so that this open source project can become easily re-usable.

The Twitter import will get improved, so that we can go beyond 100 tweets ()
