*Examining the nocode web app one year after its launch*

# Key observations

According to the Wayback machine, nocodefunctions [went live around May 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210503153337/https://nocodefunctions.com/). Since then:

- it went from 1 function to 9
- it transitioned to being fully open source in April 2022 ([:octocat:](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions))
