*Examining the nocode web app one year after its launch*

# Key observations

According to the Wayback machine, nocodefunctions [went live around May 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210503153337/https://nocodefunctions.com/). Since then:

1. it went from 1 function (sentiment analysis) to 9: sentiment analysis, creating networks from text, topic detection, turning lists into networks, gephi <-> vosviewer converter, data annotation tool, network link prediction, css highlighter, pdf matcher.
2. it transitioned to being fully open source ([:octocat:](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions))
3. it is now localized [in 107 languages](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/translated-web-app-in-107-languages-i18n/)
4. it now accepts pdf imports and tweet search and imports
5. it has ~ [200 active users per week](https://public.nocodefunctions.com/)
6. it has experienced close to zero downtime
7. it has a few dedicated users who helped with bug reports and quality checks, making the site improve much faster
