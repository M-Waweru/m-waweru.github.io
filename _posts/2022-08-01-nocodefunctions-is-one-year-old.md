*Examining the nocode web app one year after its launch*

# Key facts over the past year

According to the Wayback machine, nocodefunctions [went live around May 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210503153337/https://nocodefunctions.com/). Since then, it:

1. went from 1 function (sentiment analysis) to 9: sentiment analysis, creating networks from text, topic detection, turning lists into networks, gephi <-> vosviewer converter, data annotation tool, network link prediction, css highlighter, pdf matcher.
2. transitioned to being fully open source ([:octocat:](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions))
3. is now localized [in 107 languages](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/translated-web-app-in-107-languages-i18n/)
4. now accepts pdf imports and tweet search and imports
5. has ~ [200 active users per week](https://public.nocodefunctions.com/)
6. has experienced close to zero downtime
7. has a few dedicated users who helped with bug reports and quality checks, making the site improve much faster


# Overall feeling

The [long-term objective with nocodefunctions](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/long-game/) is to provide a free, user friendly, robust web app helping a variety of audiences to use common (but sophisticated) data analysis functions.

After a year, this objective has started being fulfilled. I got informal reports about use of nocodefunctions in classrooms, in academic research and by governing bodies.

Another objective for nocode functions is to serve as a testbench for the new functions I develop, as an academic researcher. Bringing a function to the app forces me to go beyond the development of an algorithm, however smart it is. I now must also develop a web interface for it (in 107 languages!), so that it can be featured on https://nocodefunctions.com.

This is exactly what happened with the development of a new solution that performs sentiment analysis *and provides a detailed explanation of the result - again, in 107 languages*. While I am writing the academic paper that will develop the internals of such a solution, the function is already available on the front page of nocode functions. It helped me get feedback to improve on it (thank you [Verónica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ver%C3%B3nica-espinoza/)!).
