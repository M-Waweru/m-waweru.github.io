### Your suggestions are welcome: I am developing a free web app for Best-Worst Scaling (BWS)

Best-Worst Scaling is a fantastic - yet still relatively underused - tool to collect data on how people compare / evaluate a list of items. That can be as diverse as:

- ordering a list of items from least preferred to most preferred (candidates, brands, places...)
- ordering a list of features from least to most important (political issues, product characteristics...)
- ordering a list of features from least to most important (political issues, product characteristics...)
- classifying statements or single terms based on how "relevant" they are on a given dimension 

There are many well established scales to do these kinds of ratings, such as this linear rating scale that is very commonly used:

   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1244100/141346470-14a43c76-3dd1-411c-8001-b65839618307.png" width="350"/>
</div>
Best-Worst Scaling is different. The respondent must choose among several options at once, and is simply asked to select the best and worst option:

   </kbd>
</div>
This change in the design of the questions has two important benefits:

1. contrary to rating scales, there is no trouble guessing what the respondents meant with their scoring, or correcting for possible biases (such as a tendency to choose scores near the middle of the scale).
2. faster collection of data - many items are scored at once. This reduces the number of questions to be asked.

On the first point, [a recent study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10579-020-09524-2)[^1] speaks volumes: Best Worst Scaling elicits judgements which spread smoothly and "naturally" over the space of all possibilities.
The classic methods (rating scales and pairwise comparisons) produce jittered results, which show that the design of these methods introduce noticeable distortions.
