What time have we got to develop an academic research project? What time have we got when we develop and launch an app, as an indie maker?

In my experience as a social scientist, academic projects leading to publications tend to last between 2 to 5 years. For an app (web app or else) launched by an indie maker, we often see projects that launch after less than 6 months, and the fate of the app is decided in a year or two.

For a long time I have felt uncomfortable with both these time scales.
