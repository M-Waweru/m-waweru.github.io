I read a thread the other day that was very shocking and it hit me differently. The author described that the funding that is pouring into Africa is simply a test to see if there is a market on the continent. Once the test is successful, many of these VCs and investors will pour their money into Africa and buy up local companies, talent and own all the equity. 

In essence, they will take over and they will sell us products that locally built but from foreign-owned companies. They have realised that they can't just come to Africa and start an all-white company. They need Africans in their workforce to come up with the ideas and build them out with the help of outside capital.

## Local vs. Foreign Capital

The West has a lot of capital that is laying idle and they have a model of using it. They are big on investing in the big visions of startups and will walk with founders to make this possible. This is very different from how capital in Africa works, where wealthy Africans will prefer to buy shares in large corporations, buy into government bonds, horde land and build rental apartments. Basically, African capital is conservative and utterly uncreative in it's deployment. It only sees a zero-sum game and looks for avenues to preserve itself and not take risks, despite the massive potential returns. That's why local capital always follows trends. When we hear that someone is making it big in agriculture, we want a piece of the pie. When we hear that real estate flats are profitable, we are all taking loans to buy. It's not that we don't have money, we just don't want to think very hard on how to deploy it.

## Confused and Misled

Let's face it, building new and innovative things is hard. This is the arena of the young, bold and entreprenerial people. Saldy, we don't even give them a chance. We say that there should be entrepreneurs and innovators, but we give them neither the time of day nor the capital to build. A critical element in innovation is a conducive environment for it. If we don't have the right environment, we are fooling yourselves. 

If we really cared about innovation, we would have billboards and massive social media campaigns that advertise digital innovation hubs for young people. Just as we have massive campaigns for alcohol and betting, we should advertise our innovators. If you want to know what a country cares about, look at it's billboards.

We are a confused and misled society in a world that knows what it wants. When an American comes to Africa, they see so much potential. When you talk to an African, he only sees problems. How can two people see things so differently? The Chinese see wealth in Africa and they are making moves to come and get it. They give us loans to rope us into their web. If we let them, we will be caught and eaten alive. Just as the Europeans did, the Chinese will do the same. They are not our friends, they may say they are but when it comes down to it, they will choose their own over us. That's not being pessimist, it's just human nature.

## Side-note on Human Nature

We are naturally tribalistic and we will defend our tribe as it is our means of survival. Humans dominate the world because they learnt to coordinate themselves in large numbers to fight nature. It states that each person can only communicate to a maximum of 150 people at one time, beyond that and you lose track of people. But to bring more people together, we developed abstract ideas and stories that cultivated identity and allowed the larger group to work together. As a larger group, there are a number of benefits. One, we are more productive as you have more hands on deck. This means more food, more money, more relaxation. Two, we are safer as there are more people to defend against a threat and conquer it. They is strength in numbers. Three, larger and more accessible array of mates. Basically, you have more variety on who to date and procreate with, which is made easier as you believe in the same ideas, norms and values.

Such a setup needs to be defended or evolved to meet a changing reality. The survival of each individual of the group depends on enforcing, evolving and propergating these ideas, either through knowledge or children. Groups will do this even at the expense of other groups. It's the law of nature and it is brutal. History is full of many examples of genocide, mass killings, slavement, colonisation and anhillation for civilisations. I would even go as far as saying that we are quite priviledged in the 21st century. Many past people would scoff at the problems you have now and they would kill to take your place.

## If We Do Nothing

Anyway, I was talking about Africa's latest problem, which is the capitalistic capture of the continent through equity, debt and consumerism. It is important that we move fast and put Africans first in the building of our own continent. We have many people in the West who are looking to make a fortune in Africa. They are plotting day and night on the latest strategy to milk the continent. They want wealth of their own because they have exploited their markets and created wealth from that. Now they want the low-hanging fruit. Once they have it, they will keep climbing up the African tree until all great fruits are gone. They will keep us barely alive so that we can produce more great fruits, which they will routinely pluck. The other subpar fruits will be left for us to fight over and this will cause in-fighting and cultivate a zero-sum game mindset. This is how it has always been but now they have a new strategy. 

We have to get on top of this and play them at their own game. Eventually, African startups should be buying American startups. We should flip the script like what China is doing. Eventhough they have their issues, they are proving something major and we should follow through as well. A while back, I saw a article that stated how controversial it was for Chinese company to even consider buying a power plant in Britian. This just shows you the mindset that the West has. To them, they are entitled to buying up your companies but you should never think of buying up theirs. It's good, as it shows their pride in owning their stuff, which is something that we should learn from.  

## My Ask

I am asking local capital to be more creative with how it deploys itself. Experienced generations should take a bet on young people instead of streamlining them to work in corporate jobs and give up big dreams. The young people don't need a handout, they need a hand up. That takes courage because it acknowledges a lot of weaknesses that we have as a people. As young people, we have also adopted the previous generation's worries of poverty, zero-sum mindset and the need to escape our realities. We often say statements like, "I will just make my money and mind my own business". Sure, you can make money and mind your own business, but there are vultures out here that are doing everything but minding their own business. They are buying property, companies, land, tenders, exclusive rights and so on. 

You sit there in your nicely furnished house and think you are safe. Have you not seen the shows that your children watch? Have you not noticed the apps that you use? Have you not taken note of the beer brand that you drink? Now tell me, who built these things and who has benefitted more from their distribution? I am pretty sure that an African is not the 1st person on that list. If that doesn't concern you, I don't know what else will.

## Conclusion

You are a slave to products run by foreigners. They invaded your home and you couldn't even see it. Your false illusion of security has blinded you. In fact, you are the nobility of the fools as you flaunt your status with trinkets handed down by your puppet master. A shame, a real shame.

If we want to be free as Africans, we need to control our own systems of production. We have the tools, the knowledge and the determination. We as Africans need to start supporting ourselves, instead of eating each other.

We have so much potential. What the Mzungu sees, we can also see. We just need to start thinking differently about ourselves and what we are capable of doing. If they can do it, we can do it too.
