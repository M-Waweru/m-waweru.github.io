I am the Co-founder and Product Lead at Shukran, with a background in Computer Science from Strathmore University. I am on a mission to learn all I can so I can change the world. My expertise are in software development, product development and startup-building.

### Work

* I was previously the Co-founder and Product Lead at [**Shukran**](https://shukran.co), a digital tipping and financial services platform that grows incomes and financial inclusion among service workers in Africa's hospitality industry. We launched in January 2023 and I led the team to product-market fit by January 2024. We grew by over 5,500% in 2024 alone, processing over $250K in tips overall, 4000 tippers, 3800 service workers onboarded and $4,500 in MRR by the time I left. Shukran is incubated under [**Impact Africa Network**](https://impactafrica.network).

### Projects

* **Shukran**: This is the first successful product that I have taken to market and gotten real users for. I was involved from the very beginning - doing market research, design, software development, talking to users, closing customers and running the entire operation as the team lead. It scratched an itch for innovation and building startups. For information on our [website](https://shukran.co/)

* **Agrarian**: An agritech IoT solution for farmers to collect and analyse farm conditions and make data-driven farming decisions. Worked as the Project Manager and President of Enactus Strathmore. Find more information about Agrarian [here](https://strathmore.edu/news/enactus-strathmore-to-represent-kenya-in-the-enactus-global-competition-set-for-september/)

* **Blockchain voting system**: We wanted to replace the manual voting system at Strathmore University with a digital, censorship-resistant system. It was quite buggy but we pitched it to the Student Council. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/M-Waweru/truffledapping)

* **Crowdsourcing identification of fake news on Twitter**: Fake news and misinformation cannot be solved by AI because misinformation is inherently an experiential and subjective thing. The idea was to use the Wisdom of the Crowds to decide what is true and what is false. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/M-Waweru/Crowdsourcing-Ranking-of-Tweets)


### Passions

* **Journalling**: I have been doing it chronically since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Now I cannot stop and it has led to this blog.

* **Hiking**: Nothing beats a good mountain-climb and the euphoria of standing at the top to marvel at your accomplishment.

* **Digital gardening**: Note-taking is great but it is useless if you don't reference them to take action. With digital gardening on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I have created notes that I reference from time to time to ground me on my mission and purpose. It has become a great idea factory where most of my blogs will come from. I have also shared some notes at the [Mathnuscripts](https://mathnuscripts.com). It contains draft essays that will eventually come here.


### Philosophy

> _For I do, so I must write. For I write, so I must do._

May this blog help you as much as it helps me.
