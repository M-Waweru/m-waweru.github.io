I am a social scientist and Java developer with a passion for discovering insights in big texts, networks and in unstructured data in general.

* In my 20s under the guidance of [Philippe Fontaine](https://isp.cnrs.fr/?project=fontaine-philippe) I used archives (boxes of documents! plenty of boxes!) to write a contextualized history of economics and biology in post-WWII USA.
* In my 30s under the guidance of Paul Wouters and Ale Smidts, I used scientometric data and survey data to map the field of scientometrics and highlight its interdisciplinary character
* Now in my 40s, my goal is to continue my exploration AND to make the tools I developed accessible to the public. This is the sense of https://nocodefunctions.com/
