# 🧠 About Me

I’m an **innovator, venture-builder, and leader** at the core. I love solving real-world problems with technology—especially ones that can scale impact across communities. My mantra is:

> **Express yourself. Contribute to humanity. Tell the story.**

My expertise spans **market research**, **software development** (Django, some React), **business development**, and **leading teams** to do their best work.

## 💼 Work

I was previously the **Co-founder and Product Lead at [Shukran](https://shukran.co)**—a digital tipping and financial services platform that increases income and financial inclusion for service workers in Africa’s hospitality industry.

I led the team from concept to **product-market fit** within a year, scaling:

- **$250K+** in tips processed  
- **4,000+ tippers** and **3,800+ service workers onboarded**  
- **$4,500 MRR** by the time I left  
- Over **5,500% growth in 2024**

Shukran was incubated at [**Impact Africa Network**](https://impactafrica.network).

## 🔧 Projects

### 🏨 [Shukran](https://shukran.co)

The first startup I built end-to-end. I led product research, customer interviews, development (Django + React), GTM strategy, sales, and operations. This experience deeply shaped my approach to innovation and leadership.

### 🌾 [Agrarian](https://strathmore.edu/news/enactus-strathmore-to-represent-kenya-in-the-enactus-global-competition-set-for-september/)

An IoT agritech solution helping farmers make better decisions using environmental data. I served as **Project Manager and President of Enactus Strathmore**, and we represented Kenya at the **Enactus Global Competition**.

### 🗳 Blockchain Voting System

We built a censorship-resistant voting system to replace manual student elections at Strathmore University. The system was buggy, but the pitch to the Student Council was solid.

### 📰 Crowdsourced Fake News Detection

AI can’t solve misinformation because truth is often contextual and subjective. Our idea was to use collective human judgment ("Wisdom of the Crowd") to flag fake news on Twitter.

## ❤️ Passions

- **Journaling:** I started journaling daily during the 2020 pandemic and haven’t stopped since. It grounds me, clarifies my thinking, and feeds my blog.
- **Hiking:** Mountain peaks bring clarity. I live for the climb—and the stillness at the summit.
- **Digital Gardening:** I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to build a personal knowledge system I refer to constantly. My essays grow out of this soil and are shared at [Mathnuscripts](https://mathnuscripts.com).
